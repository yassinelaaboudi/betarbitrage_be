# Belgian betting arbitrage

## Description

This project aims to identify arbitrage opportunities on Belgian sports betting websites for certain European leagues. Arbitrage situations in sports betting occur when a bettor can take advantage of differences in odds offered by different bookmakers to guarantee a profit regardless of the outcome of the event. In this project, we are focusing on identifying such opportunities for certain European leagues on Belgian sports betting websites.
